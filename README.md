# testing the just-the-docs-template

JTD is a *bare-minimum* template to create a [Jekyll] site that:

- uses the [Just the Docs] theme;
- can be built and published on [GitHub Pages];
- can be built and previewed locally, and published on other platforms.

The goal is to get this onto [GitHub Pages], where it would be hosted at https://lkwhite.github.io/jtd-test
