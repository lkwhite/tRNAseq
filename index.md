# Nanopore tRNA sequencing
{: .fs-9 }
An overview of library workflows, logistics issues, and analysis considerations
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

Direct RNA sequencing is uniquely suited to the study of tRNA biology because it enables the simultaneous capture of signals derived from a tRNA's sequence and modification status. A major limitation of previous tRNA sequencing methods is the necessity for reverse transcription to generate cDNA, despite the fact that reverse transcriptases often stall on these highly modified and structured molecules. Nanopore direct RNA sequencing approaches obviate the need to interrogate this indirect readout, instead attaching specific adapters to thread the native tRNA molecule through a pore in a charged membrane. As the nucleic acid passes through the pore, it differentially occludes the flow of ions through the aperture in a sequence and modification-dependent fashion. These changes in current over time can be converted to nucleotide sequence, and also used to infer the presence of RNA modifications.

This documenation is accurate for RNA002 chemistry. The RNA004 direct RNA sequencing kit is expected to be released in early access mode in the 2nd half of 2023, and will use a different nanopore and helicase.
